# processor-orthogonal

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/keboola/processor-orthogonal.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/keboola/processor-orthogonal)
  
This processor all CSV files (or sliced tables) in `/data/in/tables`, counts the maximum number of columns in the CSV file and fills all the rows so that each row contains the same number of columns. If some columns are missing from header, autogenerated columns are added. Manifests files are updated with the new column list. Sliced files are supported.

All CSV files must:

- not have headers
- have a manifest file with columns, delimiter and enclosure properties

# Usage
The processor takes no options.

Example configuration:

```
{  
    "definition": {
        "component": "keboola.processor-orthogonal"
    }
}
```
